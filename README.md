Squeeze and Scale

This is my entry for the 2024 Game Maker's Tool Kit game jam. The theme of the jam was "build to scale". 96 hours were given to complete a game based on this theme. 

I think I ran into a lot of issues with scope creep. I did not plan well enough or have a game design document which led to being stressed out and an unclear path forward. There were multiple iterations of the game with completely different mechanics. I learned a valuable lesson in the power of planning and sticking to that plan.
